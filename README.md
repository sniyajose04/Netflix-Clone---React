This is a Netflix Clone built using React.js, designed to mimic the look and feel of Netflixâ€™s UI. The project integrates The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data dynamically. The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of React, API integration, state management, and responsive UI design while building a real-world application.

Features

- Dynamic Movie Fetching: Retrieves trending, popular, and top-rated movies from the TMDB API.
- Category Sections: Movies are displayed in categorized sections like Trending Now, Top Rated, and Originals.
- Smooth UI & Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes with a clean Netflix-like layout.
- Hover Effects: Movie thumbnails display additional details on hover.

Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, JSX, CSS
- Data Source: TMDB API
- State Management: useState, useEffect
- Challenges & Learnings

While building this project, I faced challenges with handling API requests efficiently and managing state in a structured way. Learning to optimize API calls and properly handle responses helped me improve my React development skills.
